* Selecting a particular Screening Tool(e.g., PHQ-9, GAD-7) based on AGE the system will generate automated scoring and interpretation algorithms to assess the risk level or mental health status for the specific disorder based on the scoring system.

* Based on the severity and age of the user the system will provide some educational articles, videos, and games to enhance mental health literacy and promote awareness about various mental health conditions.

* Based on the assessment and conversation, the chatbot can provide educational content, self-help strategies, coping mechanisms, and information about various mental health conditions on a regular basis.

# Show Stoppers
- Ensuring accurate assessment of mental health status is challenging due to the subjectivity and complexity of mental health. Inaccurate assessments can lead to incorrect guidance and potentially harmful outcomes.

- Users might lose interest, forget to engage, or find the interface unappealing.

- Identifying and providing immediate support for users in a mental health crisis is crucial.

# Future Scopes
- Integration with wearables and Internet of Things (IoT) devices to gather continuous and real-time data on physiological indicators (heart rate, sleep patterns, etc.), providing a holistic view of the user's mental health.

- Emotion analysis in text or voice can help tailor responses based on the user's emotional state.

- Integrating mental health support within educational and professional platforms to create a mentally healthy environment.
